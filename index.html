  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>I'm an aspiring front end developer, who loves good books, Doctor Who, coffee, and learning new things.  I'm finishing up my associate's degree at Columbus State Community College, and am planning on graduating in May of 2015.</p>

  <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
  <p>I'm from a little (well, not so little anymore) town called Pataskala, Ohio.  Growing up, it was a small town, where everyone knew everyone. In fact, my high school graduating class had 70 people in it.  It's since grown quite a bit, and there's always something new popping up. </p>

  <h2>More About Me</h2>
   <h4> What's important to you?</h4>
	<p>In Judaism, there's something called Tikkun Olam. It's Judaism envisioning an ideal world, and is often translated to mean "repair of the world", and even as social justice.  The idea of repairing the world, of leaving things better than how we found them, is an important idea to me, and is one of the things that drew me to study Judaism.</p>

  <h4>What are your favorite hobbies?</h4>
	<p>I love to read, mostly science fiction/fantasy, biographies, cookbooks, and comics. I also play video games, mostly World of Warcraft, Sims 4, and the occasional shooter.  I'm horrible at first person shoooters, but still keep trying to play Borderlands 2. I'm also a fan of Doctor Who, Firefly, Star Wars, and Star Trek. Picard will always be my favorite Captain. </p>

  <h4>What's your dream job?</h4>
	<p>My end goal is to find work as a web developer. Ideally, I'd like to find some way to combine being a developer with social projects that mean a lot to me. </p>

  <h4>What music have you been listening to lately?</h4>
	<p>Lately, I've been listening to the <a href="http://www.theblackkeys.com/?frontpage=true">The Black Keys</a>, who I was able to see when they kicked off their Turn Blue tour here in Columbus, OH.  I'm also listening to <a href="http://www.alabamashakes.com/">Alabama Shakes</a>, whom I only recently discovered. </p>
